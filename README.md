> **A decentralized, encrypted communication node running entirely in the browser.**

The **NEURAL LINK P2P SYSTEM** is a standalone web application designed for secure, ephemeral messaging. It utilizes peer-to-peer technology to establish a direct connection between users without storing message data on a central server.

## ⚡ System Capabilities

### 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
* **No Server Storage:** Messages are transmitted directly between clients. No database stores your conversations.
* **End-to-End Encryption:** All data is encrypted locally before transmission and decrypted only by the intended recipient.
* **Ephemeral Data:** Sessions are temporary. Once the window is closed, the data is wiped.

### 🖥️ Immersive Interface
* **Futuristic UI:** Built with a "Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi" aesthetic featuring 3D animations and holographic visual elements.
* **Responsive Core:** Optimized for both desktop terminals and mobile devices.

### 📡 Connectivity
* **Instant Connection:** Generates unique connection IDs/links for rapid pairing.
* **Cross-Platform:** Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari) without installation.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

This system is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** to ensure portability and security.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Keyframes & 3D Transforms)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Networking:** WebRTC (Peer-to-Peer Data Channels) / PeerJS
* **Encryption:** AES / RSA (Client-side implementation)

## 🚀 How to Initialize

### Method 1: Live Access (Recommended)
Access the stable build through the main portal or direct link:
* **Main Portal:** [Launch via Portal](https://omaairsk.github.io/NEURAL-LINK-Portal/)
* **Direct System:** [Initialize System](https://omaairsk.github.io/NEURAL-LINK-P2P-SYSTEM/)

### Method 2: Local Deployment
You can run this system entirely offline or on a local server.

1.  **Clone the Source:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/omaairsk/NEURAL-LINK-P2P-SYSTEM.git](https://github.com/omaairsk/NEURAL-LINK-P2P-SYSTEM.git)
    ```
2.  **Launch:**
    Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## 📖 Usage Guide

1.  **Initialize:** Open the application. The system will generate a unique **Neural ID**.
2.  **Connect:** Share your ID with a peer, or input their ID into the "Target Connection" field.
3.  **Handshake:** Once connected, the status indicator will turn **GREEN**.
4.  **Transmit:** Type your message and hit send. The data flows directly to the peer.
